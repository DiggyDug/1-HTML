		<h2>General Information</h2>

		<p> A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the 
		automotive industry. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on 
		roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be 
		constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods.[2][3] The year 1886 is regarded 
		as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz 
		Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first 
		cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford 
		Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced 
		animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts 
		of the world.</p>

		<p>Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and 
		controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to 
		vehicles, making them progressively more complex. Examples include rear reversing cameras, air 
		conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled 
		by an internal combustion engine, fueled by deflagration of gasoline (also known as petrol) or diesel. 
		Both fuels cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to climate change and global 
		warming.[4] Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas 
		vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Electric cars, which were invented early in the 
		history of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008.</p>

Hi!

Github is what we're going to be using in order to manage multiple people working on the same project(s) at the same time.

The system works by there existing a 'Master' version of the project and then you can create 'branches' which are copies of the master.
Branches allow you to do whatever you want to the master's files without actuallly affecting the master file itself,
basically like saving a file to your desktop, it wont affect the version you got from online.

When you have created and changed the branch and are happy that it works then you can merge the changes to the master version by
making a pull request, one of us can then double check it and then complete the merge.

For a guide with pictures on how to do the specifics, please read https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world`
